## Scripts 
1\. Creates detection histories from the camera data. One file created is presence-absence and the other is counts. 

2\. Creates spatial covariate layers and extracts them for the camera sites

3\. Fits a Multi-species N-mixture model in Nimble 

4\. Uses the model to make predictions of abundance under a range of scenarios

5\. Uses prioritizr to run optimisations that find the fire age class distribution under alternate scenarios

6\. Plots the optimisation results for publication

7\. Makes some additional plots for inclusion in the publication
